        <h1><strong>My tech Journey</strong></h1>
        <p><h3>I started my tech journey in 9th grade when I took a computer science class.
            During class, I learned the basics of computer science, for example, I learned 
            how to use python. After 9th grade, I haven't had a computer scence class ever since.
            It was not until 12th grade that I took another computer scince class. In 12th grade
            I took advance computer science and AP Computer science. I didn't particulary struggle
            because I've already has some background with coding so it was easy to understand the claases.
