        <p>My Favorite sport growing up was football, I enjoy playing and watching it. 
            In elementary school, I always played football with my friends during reccess. 
            Once I entered middle school I played soccer less because there was no field to 
            play in during reccess. During this time, I started watching football more, I 
            enjoy watching the best club in the world Real Madrid.
