    <h1><strong>The History of Football</strong></h1>

    <p>
      Records trace the origins of the sport back more than 2,000 years ago to ancient 
      China, Greece and Rome, where the 'ball' was made of rock or animal hide stuffed 
      with hair. There have even been suggestions it dates even further back to old 
      Mesoamerican cultures - but 'football' or 'soccer' as we know it today has its roots
      in 19th century England.
    </p>
    <p>
      From England, the idea of football spread to Europe and across the Atlantic. 
      Two schoolteachers, August Hermann and Konrad Koch, introduced the game to Germany
      circa 1874. Immigrants, meanwhile, are thought to have brought soccer to the United
      States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first football association was formed in England in 1863. Rules were established
      - but continued to change - and the size and weight of the match-ball standardised.
      Crucially, carrying the ball with the hands was outlawed: association football 
      (soccer) and rugby became two separate entities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Football continued to undergo rapid development into the 1900s, accelerated by 
      industrialisation. Public school teams soon became the minority following the 
      emergence of factory and other work-based clubs. The best players received monetary 
      incentives, and tickets were sold to the public - mainly members of the working-class
      - for matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Domestic leagues became commonplace around the world - the English Football League 
      being the first professional division. In Germany, football was played at an amateur
      level until 1949, when semi-professional leagues were introduced. The country's 
      first professional division, the Bundesliga, started in 1963/64. Forty-six clubs 
      from the former West Germany applied for admission to the new league. Sixteen were 
      selected based on their sporting track record, economic criteria and representation
      of the various sub-regional leagues. Until 2001, the Bundesliga was directly under
      the auspices of the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB or German Football Association).
      This changed with the formation of the Deutsche Fußball-Liga (DFL or German 
      Football League).

    <p>The UEFA European Football Championship, more commonly known as the Euros, is the 
    primary association football competition contested by the senior men's national teams 
    of the members of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), determining the 
    continental champion of Europe. It is held every four years, in the even-numbered year
    between World Cups. The first edition took place in 1960. The CONCACAF Gold Cup, the 
    main association football competition of the men's national football teams governed by
    The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football 
    (CONCACAF), determining the continental champion of North America, Central America, 
    and the Caribbean, is staged every two years.

      Today 211 national associations are members of FIFA, football's world governing body.
      The world regions are divided into six confederations: Confédération Africaine de Football (CAF), 
      Asian Football Confederation (AFC), UEFA, CONCACAF, Oceania Football Confederation (OFC),
      and Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol (CONMEBOL). While 32 countries took part in
      World Cup qualifying in 1934, that number has risen to over 200, reflecting football’s
      standing as a truly global phenomenon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early soccer leagues in the US mostly adopted the name 'football' for their activities,
      but confusion between American football and association football resulted in the term
      'soccer' being used to describe the latter in the 1910s and early 1920s. Two professional
      soccer leagues were started in 1967, the United Soccer Association and the National 
      Professional Soccer League, which merged to form the North American Soccer League in 
      1968. Interest in soccer within the United States continued to grow and, as part of 
      the United States' bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup, US Soccer pledged to create a 
      professional outdoor league. Major League Soccer duly launched in 1996.

      Latter-day continental club tournaments have existed, in various guises, for many 
      years. Europe's UEFA Champions League and the Americas' CONCACAF Champions League 
      are perhaps the best known. Interleague club competition can be traced back as far 
      as the late 19th century, but international club tournaments are a relatively new 
      concept. In 2000, the FIFA Club World Cup was born, a tournament between the winners
      of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's league champions.
      Since 2005, it has become an annual event.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the late 19th century, only a few national football teams existed, England and 
      Scotland among them. Germany has been represented in international football 
      competitions since 1908, while the first US national soccer team was constituted in 
      1885. Football became an International Olympics Committee-recognised sport in 1900, 
      but it wasn't until 1930 that FIFA - football's world governing body - decided to 
      stage their own international tournament, the World Cup. With the exception of 
      cancellations in 1942 and 1946 due to World War II - the tournament has taken place 
      every four years since.
