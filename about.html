    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p><h3> 
        My name is Anthony Martinez and I am currently 18 years old.
        I attend DSST Cole High School and I am in the 12th grade.
        My plans after High School is to go to a college in colorado and study either 
        engineering or business and if possible both. Some of my favorite hobbies is to play
        sports such as soccer and volleyball. My favorite subject from school is math because
        it's easy for me to understand. My favorite food is mexican food because I grew up eating 
        mexican food.
